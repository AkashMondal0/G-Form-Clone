The Next.js Quiz App is a dynamic, interactive online application created to immerse users in a quiz-taking experience that is both entertaining and educational.

The app gains from static typing thanks to TypeScript, improving code dependability and facilitating improved developer cooperation. In addition to guaranteeing a sound development process, it offers a strong foundation for creating scalable and maintainable code.


User authentication, database management, and real-time updates are just a few of the functions that Firebase is connected to handle for the app. In addition to enabling effective data storage and retrieval, this enables a seamless and secure user experience.

The creation of this website makes use of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

Features:

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely access their quiz progress and results.
- Quiz Creation: Admin users can create quizzes with various types of questions (multiple choice, true/false, etc.).
- Quiz Taking: Users can take quizzes, answer questions.
- Real-time Updates: Firebase's real-time database allows for instant updates on quiz results.
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to provide an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
